Changed hallo world header to Fingertips store, and removed it from the page. 
Replaced the thicker line from the cart, and removed the one under the total order value. 
Gave the item names more padding and less to the Total order value.
Product cards are more rounded now.
Added a plus field to the left top of the item -> discount %
Moved the description icon to the right top of the item
Alligned the the product name and prices to the middle, the original price is now under the name and crossed
Added a plus icon to the cart button, and increased the size of the text
Gave the product image a background to seem more separated
Gave both the card and button hovering effects
On the tooltip I have moved the key features section under the picture to fill the area more.
And lastly on checkout the cart resets and the user will get rick rolled.
